# V-ASSIST: Vehicle Assistnace And Safety System.
## Co-created by Vaibhav Alur (https://github.com/vb47).
## A KSCST(KARNATAKA STATE COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY) Funded Project.
## Project Demo Video: https://youtu.be/MFlJA702ifs

### Problem Scenario: 
“KPIT research and development team observed that more that 50% of total 
accidents occur at highway. Highway road network which comprises of only 5% of total road 
network, need extra layer of safety measures to reduce accident rates. In this regard, KPIT wants to 
overcome this problem by introducing Advanced Driving Assistance System (ADAS) to modern 
automobiles.”

### Problem Statement: 
“To overcome the issue raised by KPIT over the highway safety aspect, we 
propose an ADAS based system titled “V-ASSIST” comprising of four features – Adaptive Cruise 
Control (ACC), Lane Assistance System (LAS), Emergency Braking System (EBS) and Blind Spot 
Detection (BSD). The objective is to solve the major cause of accidents on highway which are 
generally human errors, lack of quick response in the time of emergency.”
